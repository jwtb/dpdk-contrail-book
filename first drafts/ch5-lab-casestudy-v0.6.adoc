:appendix!:

In previous chapters, we have gone through most important topics about SDN and
DPDK in general, DPDK vRouter architectures, vRouter packet processing details
and so on. When you read these topics you may wonder how to get a running
contrail networking environment with a few DPDK vRouters in it, so you can play
around, test those theories and familiarize yourself about what you've learned.
Indeed, those topics are important, unfortunately they are by themselves not so
straightforward, so even after we've put great effort to illustrate, some of
them may still sound confusing, especially when you get down to the
implementation details.

In this chapter, we will mostly focus on the hands-ons and lab testings to
verify some of the most important DPDK vRouter concepts and working mechanisms.

* We'll start from introducing steps we've used to install a latest version of
  contrail networking cluster.
* On top of it, we start to build a testing environment.  That includes a few
  VMs running OPENFV PROX software. On each VM, based on its role, the PROX
  software is configured as either a traffic generator or a traffic receiver.
* We'll go ahead to introduce some of the commonly used DPDK tools, scripts and
  log entries that provides useful information to help us understand how things
  run in DPDK environment.
* In the end, we'll go over some case studies. We use PROX and rapid we've
  installed to start different traffic patterns in our setup, and then use DPDK
  tools to analyze what we are seeing.

After reading this chapter, you will have a deeper and concrete understanding
to the some of the main concepts we've covered in this book.
We'll start with the contrail installation.

== contrail installation

=== contrail installation methods

In this book, we've been focusing on DPDK vRouter that runs in each individual
compute node, which basically runs in a relatively standalone mode. but if you
look at forwarding plane as a whole, they are actually a distributed system. In
fact as we've briefed in chapter 1, the whole TF cluster is a complex
distributed system involving a lot more different software modules especially
in control plane. Again, each of the software module can be a completely
different distributed system by themselves. The cassandra database that TF
cluster uses is one such example. Explaining and understanding details about how
things works in distributed system is never easy, and so is the installation
process. It won't be a surprise if you run into some installation issues in
your lab. Generally speaking, it is always much more efficient to follow a
detailed, verfied process with step by step instructions to "avoid" the issues,
than starting with a "try-and-see" mode and then try to fix the issues.

Currently, TF cluster has been widely integrated with many majority deployment
systems and platforms. Therefore depending on your envrionment there can be
totally different ways of installing contrail system. Here is a incomplete list
of currently supported installation methods:

* Installing Contrail with OpenStack and Kolla Ansible
* Installing Contrail with RHOSP
* Installing Kubernetes Contrail Cluster using the Contrail Command UI
* Installing and Provisioning Contrail VMware vRealize Orchestrator Plugin
* Installing a Standalone Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 Cluster
  with Contrail Using Contrail OpenShift Deployer
* Installing a Nested Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 Cluster Using
  Contrail Ansible Deployer
* Installing Contrail with OpenStack or kubernetes by Using Juju Charms

For example, the second method, you can install contrail with Redhat openstack
platform director 13 (RHOSPd), which is a toolset based on the OpenStack
project TripleO (OOO, OpenStack on OpenStack).  An TF environment built out of
RHOSPd uses concepts of `undercloud` and `overcloud`. Basically `undercloud` is
a single server containing complete OpenStack components, whose role is just to
deploy and manage an `overcloud`, which is a tenant-facing environment that
hosts the "resulting" openstack and TF nodes. This deployment is currently used
by many major service providers in production.

However, the installation process of such a deployment involves the
understanding of RHOSPd, TripleO, and of lots of different types of networks
isolation topologies, which add many uncessary complexities to our lab setup.
In this section, we'll give a detail steps about the first method - installing
contrail with openstack and kolla ansible.

Kolla is an OpenStack project which provides tools to build container images
for OpenStack services.  Kolla Ansible provides Ansible playbooks to deploy the
Kolla images.  The contrail-kolla-ansible playbook works in conjunction with
contrail-ansible-deployer to install OpenStack and Contrail Networking
containers.

//=== re-image servers

=== configure bond and vlan

To enable bond interface in centos, under `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` of
all nodes where bond interface is needed, add these configuration files:

[options="header", width="100%",cols="a,a"]
|====
 | bond | members

//row1
 |
[source, sh, linenums]
----
$ cat ifcfg-bond0
SUBCHANNELS=1,2,3
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
BONDING_OPTS="miimon=100 mode=802.3ad xmit_hash_policy=layer3+4"
DEVICE=bond0
BONDING_MASTER=yes
ONBOOT=yes
----
 |
[source, sh, linenums]
----
$ cat ifcfg-bond0.101
NM_CONTROLLED=no
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
BOOTPROTO=none
DEVICE=bond0.101
VLAN=yes
IPADDR=8.0.0.3
ONBOOT=yes
----

//row2
 |
[source, sh, linenums]
----
$ cat ifcfg-enp2s0f0
HWADDR=00:1b:21:bb:f9:46
SLAVE=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
MASTER=bond0
DEVICE=enp2s0f0
ONBOOT=yes
----
 |
[source, sh, linenums]
----
$ cat ifcfg-enp2s0f1
HWADDR=00:1b:21:bb:f9:47
SLAVE=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=no
BOOTPROTO=none
MASTER=bond0
DEVICE=enp2s0f1
ONBOOT=yes
----
|====

Then restart network service to invoke these configurations:

    service network restart

Once the restart is successful, you should see bond0 interface appearing in all
nodes with one of these IP addresses in each node: 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.4. Now we
should have the IP connectivities in both management network and fabric
network.

Next we'll need to install ansible and use it to automate the rest part of the
installations. The most part of ansible's magic is done throught its
`playbooks`, and configuration for all plays is done in a single file with a
default name `instances.yaml`. This configuration file has multiple main
sections. We'll go over some of the main parameters in this file and then
introduce the steps to run the playbooks.

  configured and used by keepalived, HAproxy can forward the access request
  coming from the management network to the to Horizon service.

////
By default, all OpenStack services listen on the IP interface provided by the
kolla_internal_vip_address/network_interface variables under the kolla_globals
section in config/instances.yaml. In most cases this corresponds to the
ctrl-data network, which means that even Horizon will now run only on the
ctrl-data network. The only way Kolla provides access to Horizon on the
management network is by using HAProxy and keepalived. Enabling keepalived
requires a virtual IP for VRRP, and it cannot be the interface IP. There is no
way to enable HAProxy without enabling keepalived when using Kolla
configuration parameters. For this reason,you need to provide two virtual IP
addresses: one on management (kolla_external_vip_address) and one on
ctrl-data-network (kolla_internal_vip_address).  With this configuration,
Horizon will be accessible on the management network by means of the
kolla_external_vip_address.
////

////
The instance configuration
has a few provider-specific knobs. The instance configuration specifies which roles are installed on which
instance. Additionally, instance-wide and role-specific Contrail and Kolla configurations can be specified,
overwriting the parameters from the global Contrail and Kolla configuration settings.

=== installation steps

Once the yaml file is carefully prepared, the installation process is
relatively easy. Basically we select one node as the deployment node, this is
the node from where we want to automate the installation of all other nodes. In
practice, we use controller node as the deployment node.  In this node we need
to install some pre-requisite software packages, such as python libraries,
`ansible`, `git`, etc. python modules (e.g `python-wheel`) are used by ansible,
and `ansible` is our automation tool. `git` is used to clone a github
repository which includes all ansible playbooks. We then use ansible to
automate the software installation in all nodes based on the playbooks and our
configuration file `instances.yaml`. The detail steps are here:

. install pre-requisite packages on deployment node, in our case it's the
  controller `a2s2`

    yum -y remove python-netaddr
    yum -y install epel-release python-pip gcc python-cffi python-devel bcrypt==3.1.7 sshpass python-wheel
    pip install wheel requests
    yum -y install git
    pip install ansible==2.5.2.0

. use git to clone install ansible deployer folder into deployment node:

    git clone http://github.com/tungstenfabric/tf-ansible-deployer
    cd tf-ansible-deployer

. place the prepared configuration file `instances.yaml` to
  `tf-ansible-deployer/config`

//(Ref for version: https://svl-artifactory.juniper.net/artifactory/contrail-nightly/contrail-vrouter-agent-dpdk/)

. install contrail with ansible

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator=openstack playbooks/configure_instances.yml
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/install_openstack.yml
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator=openstack playbooks/install_contrail.yml

. install openstack client

    pip install --ignore-installed python-openstackclient python-ironicclient openstack-heat


// source /etc/kolla/kolla-toolbox/admin-openrc.sh

Once everything succeeds, you will have an up and running 4 nodes contrail
cluster (1 controller node and 3 vRouter/compute node). You can login to the
setup through webUI or ssh session to check the system running status.

=== post-installation verification

Here is the contrail web UI for a working setup:

//TODO: GIVE webUI capture here.
image::../diagrams/ch6/contrailweb.png[contrail-web]

You can also login to each individual nodes with ssh, and run `contrail-status`
command to verify the running status of each components of it.

If everything works, congratulations! You now have your own lab to play with.
Next, we'll go over the steps of setting up testing tools to send and receive
traffic - the PROX and rapid script.

== dpdk vRouter test tools: prox and rapid

=== introduction

.PROX

PROX (Packet pROcessing eXecution Engine) is an OPNFV project application built
on top of DPDK. It is capable of performing various operations on packets in a
highly configurable manner. It also support performance statistics that can be
used for performance investigations. Because of the rich feature set it
supports, it can be used to create flexible software architectures through
small and readable configuration files. In this chapter we'll introduce how to
use it to test vrouter performance in DPDK environment.

In a typical test you need two VMs running PROX.
VM1 is generating packets, sending them to VM2 which will perform a "swap"
operation on all packets, so that they are sent back to VM1.

* "traffic generator" VM ("gen" VM)
* "traffic receiver and looping VM" VM ("swap" VM, or "loop" VM)

In this book we will call them "gen" and "swap" VM respectively.  One special
feature we used here is that, the "swap" PROX is configured in such a way that,
once receives the packets sent from the generator, it will "swap", or "loop"
them back to the generator VM, so the latter can collect them and calculate how
much traffic got forwarded by the DUT - in our case it is the DPDK vRouter.

.rapid

Rapid(Rapid Automated Performance Indication for Dataplane) is a groups of
"wrapper" scripts interacting with PROX to simplify and automate the
configuration of PROX.  It is a set of files and scripts offering an even
easier way to do a sanity check of the dataplane performance.

rapid is very powerful and configurable. A typical workflow is like below:

* A script name `runrapid.py` will send the proper configuration files to the
  gen and swap VMs involved in the testing, so each one will knows its role
  ("generator" or "swapper") in the test.
* It then starts PROX within both VMs, as generator and swapper respectively.
* While the test is ongoing it collects the results from PROX. Results are
  printed on the screen and logged in the log and csv files.
* The same tests will be done for different packet sizes, different
  amounts of flows, under certain latency and packets drop rate.

////
An example of the output can be seen in Figure 3: Screen shot . In the first
test in this example, VM1 is sending the same 64 byte UDP packet to VM2. We are
requesting to send at 100% (PROX is using a 10Gb/s interface as the equivalent
of 100%). You will see that the underlying infrastructure (a vSwitch in this
case) can only accept +-1.4Mpps. The test is declared successful if the loss &
latency criteria are met and if we are able to send the requested number of
packets through the NIC. This second criterion is added since the packet loss
calculation is based on the number of packets that made it through the NIC.

The thresholds for these criteria are defined in the test files

We have now a binary search algorithm to find the speed at which we still pass
the criteria. Note that in the first table, we also print the reason for the
failure of the test in red.
////

The rapid scripts are typically installed in a third VM, called "jump" VM in
this book. The purpose of this VM is to control the traffic generator to start,
stop, pause the test as well as collecting the statistics.

.PROX and rapid test setup

//small and readable configuration files.

A typical prox and rapid testing setup looks like this:

.testing diagram
image::../diagrams/appendix/prox-setup.png[prox setup]

The test setup consists of three compute nodes, running the above mentioned 3
VMs respectively:

* "PROX generate VM" runs on compute-A: This is the "traffic generator" VM for
  traffic generation
* "PROX looping VM" runs on compute-B: This is the "swap" VM for looping
  traffic out of the same interface where it came in. This is the DUT (device
  under test) where the vRouter is running.
* "rapid jump VM" runs on compute-C: This is the VM where rapid scripts are
  installed, it is responsible for control traffic genaration and collecting
  results

////
The traffic generator is also a VM running PROX hosted by vRouter in
compute-A. There is a third VM called Control traffic VM which is running in
compute-C.
////

.Hardware requirements

Here is a brief summary of hardware requirements for different VM:

* swap VM: this is where the DUT (vRouter) is located. Based on the test
  requirement a specific amount of hardware resources should be allocated and
  all applications that could unnecessarily consume the hardware resources
  should be removed.
* gen VM: In order to saturate the DUT, the traffic generator VM and the
  compute should be allocated much more CPU resources than the DUT.
* Jump VM: no high speed VM is required, can be run on kernel or DPDK compute)
* Optionally, the generator and receiver computes can run on a bonded
  interface configured with 802.3ad LACP mode. This is a common configuration
  recommended in practical environment.

.PROX setup in our lab

NOTE: By default, `multi-queue` is enabled on both Prox gen and swap VMs via
openstack image property. You can refer to chapter 3 for more details about
"multi-queue" feature and its configurations. Additionally, Rapid scripts also
provides CPU pinning to protect PROX PMDs against CPU stealing by other
processes and the VM Operating System.

=== installation: manual steps

////
TODO: need a rewording.
unfortunately due some custom patching/fork we have compiled in into
vRouter bin, so it is only used by vrouter-dpdk process and not for general
other dpdk apps.

TODO: steps still fail

TODO: explain why re-compile is needed? - pre-built prox doesn't work in
pre-built VM?

////

.creating openstack resources

As mentioned earlier, to perform the test we need two VM both running PROX. One
sending traffic and the other one receive and swap it back. Same exact PROX
application is running but with different configuration files.

Apparently, the IP level connectivity is required in order for the two VM to be
able to exchange packets with each other. In our case, the two VM will be
spawned by openstack nova. Needless to say, all supporting objects and
resources associcated to the VMs, like IPAM, subnet, virtual-network and VM
flavor (size of CPU/memory/storage/etc), also need to be created out of
openstack infrastructure, either from horizon webUI or openstack CLIes. A quick
list of the common tasks are listed here:

* create IPAMs/subnets/virtual networks
* create flavors
* create images
* create host aggregates
* create instances
* create key-pairs

On top of these, installing PROX inside of the VMs, like with many other open
source projects, often requires downloading the source code and compile it in
your platform.  That means you download the PROX source codes, compile it to
get the execute, then configure and run the application. In this section we'll
introduce how PROX is installed in our setup we built for this book, You can
find more details in PROX website here:
https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/SAM/PROX+installation

The software and CPU model we use here are shown below:

    [root@a7s3 ~]# cat /etc/centos-release
    CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)

    [root@a7s3 ~]# uname -a
    Linux a7s3 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Aug 7 18:08:02 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

    [root@a7s3 ~]# lscpu | grep Model
    Model:                 62
    Model name:            Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v2 @ 2.10GHz

In our lab setup the VM OS is the same as the host, and the emulated CPU Model
is `Intel Xeon E3-12xx`:

    [root@stack2-gen ~]# cat /etc/centos-release
    CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core)

    [root@stack2-gen ~]# uname -a
    Linux stack2-gen.novalocal 3.10.0-1062.18.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Mar 17 23:49:17 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

    [root@stack2-gen ~]# lscpu | grep -i Model
    Model:                 58
    Model name:            Intel Xeon E3-12xx v2 (Ivy Bridge, IBRS)

NOTE: There is a good chance that your servers and VM may have totally
different hardware and software architectures. The steps below are tested and
working fine in our setup, but depending on your environment it may works just
fine or run into some errors. Check PROX online document for more detailed
instructions.

.Compiling and building DPDK

PROX is a dpdk application. When running, it connects to the DPDK libraries to
implement most of its features. Therefore to build it we need a DPDK
environment.

TIP: You can either build it inside of the VM where you want to run it,
or build it directly in the host environment where the VM got spawned and copy
it into the VM.

The steps to build DPDK in our setup is as below:

Add the following to the end of ~/.bashrc file

[source, sh, linenums]
----
sudo yum install numactl-devel net-tools wget gcc unzip libpcap-devel \
     ncurses-devel libedit-devel pciutils lua-devel kernel-devel

export RTE_SDK=/root/dpdk
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
export RTE_KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/`ls /lib/modules`/build
export RTE_UNBIND=$RTE_SDK/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py
#Re-login or source that file
. ~/.bashrc
#Build DPDK
git clone https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk
cd dpdk
git checkout v19.11
make install T=$RTE_TARGET
----

TIP: `19.11` is the stable and recommended version of DPDK at the time of
writing of this book.

////
there is an issue during compiling. the running kernel is 1062. but the
installed kernel-header file is 1127. so compiling fails. solution is to
install kernel 1127 or install kernel-header for 1062. here we change 2 options
in `common_linux` and it works.

[root@a7s3 ~]# uname -r
3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64

[root@a7s3 dpdk]# rpm -qa | grep kernel

.Compiling PROX

Now with DPDK libraries built, we can start to download, extract and build the
PROX application. Here are the steps:

[source, sh, linenums]
----
git clone https://github.com/opnfv/samplevnf
cd samplevnf/VNFs/DPPD-PROX
git checkout origin/master
make
----

When `make` succeeds, the compiled binary PROX will be available in `build`
folder of current directory.

We'll demonstrate this later.

.configuration files

The set of sample configuration files can be found in: `./config` folder.
Sample configs of PROX functioning as the "generator" is available in `./gen/`
folder.

Assuming the current directory is where you've just built PROX, we can just
launch PROX with a proper configuration file.

    ./build/prox -f <prox configuration file>

When it runs, a ncurse based UI will pop up and through it you will see update
about the running states in real time. We'll give an example on this later.

.Rapid installation

Rapid scripts can be downloaded from here:
https://github.com/opnfv/samplevnf/tree/master/VNFs/DPPD-PROX/helper-scripts/rapid
The scripts were developed in python, so you can run them directly and no need
to compile.

//TODO: check with prz

=== installation: heat automation

We have just introduced the steps of manually compiling PROX from source code. We
also has assumed you know how to perform a list of tasks to create all
necessary objects required by the VMs from openstack. Doing this one time
is not a big deal. Suppose you are working in a dynamic environment where you
often need to:

* quickly build up a PROX test environment to do some tests
* tear it down after the test is finished
* redo the same test all over again in another cluster

Repeating these manual steps will become a tedious and even painful job.  You
will soon prefer to be able to simplify the building, creation and
configuration of PROX, as well as creating all necessary openstack resources.
In openstack environment the NO. 1 choice for automation is `heat`. With
`heat`, typically all tasks are programmed in a template file, with calls all
parameters from another environment file. In appendix, we provide all sample
template file as long as environment file and associcated scripts, which are
tested and proved to be working fine in our setup. You can use them as a
starting point, then make necessary customizations based on your environment to
build your owen automation. The virtual machine, where the tools are running,
including rapid scripts and PROX DPDK application that is pre-compiled in it,
has also been built as an image . With all these automations carefully designed
and tested, all what we need to do now becomes much simpler:

* download this pre-built image and load it into openstack image service
* create the heat stack with the sample template files

If everything goes well, you will have your whole PROX testing environment
available in just a few minutes. The detail steps are listed below:

. Prepare pre-built VM image, heat template files and scripts
+
--
  * VM image: this is the image with PROX compiled, as shown in previous section.
//  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bX6e7RdKzmay4yisaiqYcXT-a4B0EUCN/view?usp=sharing[jnpr gdrive]
  * Adjust the heat template, environment variables and automation scripts
    based on your environment: footnote:[These files are available in this
    https://github.com/damjanek/dpdk-prox-contrail[github repository]]

      ** environment.yaml
      ** build-rapid.yml
      ** configure.rapid.sh
--

//TODO: upload to github and give the URL?

. Load rapid image into opentack glance service

    openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public --file rapidVM.qcow2 rapidVM-1908
    openstack image set --property hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled="true" rapidVM-1908

. (Optionally) if you're using ceph backend:

    qemu-img convert rapidVM-1908.qcow2 rapidVM-1908.raw
    openstack image create --disk-format raw --container-format bare --public --file rapidVM.raw rapidVM-1908
    openstack image set --property hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled="true" rapidVM-1908

. Create heat stack with the prepared yaml files:

    openstack stack create -t build-rapid.yml -e environment.yaml stack2

Wait for a few minutes and use `openstack stack list` command to check the
stack creation progress.

.login to the VMs

//The image has been configured with a root password Login `c0ntrail123`. 
So all 3 VMs, once up and running, will inheritage the same login credential
defined in the heat template and scripts.
In contrail/openstack integration environment There are a few common ways to
access a VM running in a specific compute node:

* floating IP: This is an routable IP address that is visible from outside of
  the cluster which maps to an internal IP of the VM. Once VM is launched, you
  can login to a specific VM with this IP address from anywhere that is able to
  reach the IP.
* virsh console: virsh provides access to the VM console. This does not require
  any IP address to be configured.
* meta_ip_address: This is a non-routable private IP that visible only from
  a specific compute. This IP address is automatically generated and mapped to
  the VM's tap interface IP.

In our test we didn't configure any floating IP, so we will use console and
meta_ip_address to access the VM. To access VM console use `virsh console`
command from `nova_libvirt` docker in the compute node:

    [root@a7s3 ~]# docker exec -it nova_libvirt virsh list
     Id    Name                           State

    [root@a7s3 ~]# docker exec -it nova_libvirt virsh console 2

Comparing with console, `ssh` session is usually preferred. Let's take a look
at each VM's allocated interface IPs with `openstack server list` command:

let's take our "jump" VM `stack2-jump` for instance. Openstack allocated an IP
address `192.168.0.106` to it's tap interface from the `stack2-control`
virtual-network. However, this IP address is not directly reachable from the
host. In order to ssh into the VM, we need to first locate the
`meta_ip_address` allocated to the VM's tap interface, or more specifically,
the `vif` interface in vRouter. We can use vRouter `vif` command to confirm
which vif interface has this IP.

[source, sh, linenums]

[root@a7s5-kiran ~]# contrail-tools vif -l | grep -B2 -A6 192.168.0.106

Good. `vif0/3` has the IP, so this `vif` connects to the tap interface of our
jump VM. In contrail vRouter, for each `vif` there is also a "hidden"
`meta_data_ip` of "169.254.0.N", wherre N is the same number as the number in
the interface `vif0/N`. Therefore in this case our `meta_data_ip` is
"169.254.0.3". Let's try to start a ssh session into it:

    [root@a7s5-kiran ~]# ssh 169.254.0.3
    Password:
    Last login: Wed Sep 23 11:13:58 2020
    [root@stack2-jump ~]#

It works. The benefit of this approach is that, not only the interaction with
the VM is much faster, but also it supports file copies with `scp` tool.
Remember in many cases the VM does not has any Internet connection, so in case
you need to copy files into (or out of) the VM, the `meta_data_ip` method will
be especially useful.

=== run rapid automation: runrapid.py

With the stack created and all VMs up and running, we now can introduce how to
run test with rapid. Remember rapid is installed in the "jump" VM, so we'll
need to execute the script from there.

On Jump VM, go to `/root/prox/helper-scripts/rapid/` folder, where you can
locate a python script named "runrapid.py". To run test you can just run it
without any other parameters:

    cd /root/prox/helper-scripts/rapid/
    ./runrapid.py

TIP: This is symbolic link, by default this `rapid` folder links to:
`/opt/openstackrapid/samplevnf/VNFs/DPPD-PROX/helper-scripts/rapid/`

This will start rapid script and send traffic for 10 seconds by default. the
period of time for sending traffic can be adjusted by `--runtime` option:

    cd /root/prox/helper-scripts/rapid/
    ./runrapid.py --runtime <time> # replace <time> with time per one execution in seconds

A few other command line options are supported, which can be listed by `-h`:

    [root@stack2-jump rapid]# ./runrapid.py -h
    usage: runrapid    [--version] [-v]
                       [--env ENVIRONMENT_NAME]
                       [--test TEST_NAME]
                       [--map MACHINE_MAP_FILE]
                       [--runtime TIME_FOR_TEST]
                       [--configonly False|True]
                       [--log DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL]
                       [-h] [--help]

    Command-line interface to runrapid

    optional arguments:
      -v,  --version                Show program's version number and exit
      --env ENVIRONMENT_NAME        Parameters will be read from ENVIRONMENT_NAME. Default is rapid.env.
      --test TEST_NAME              Test cases will be read from TEST_NAME. Default is basicrapid.test.
      --map MACHINE_MAP_FILE        Machine mapping will be read from MACHINE_MAP_FILE. Default is machine.map.
      --runtime                     Specify time in seconds for 1 test run
      --configonly                  If this option is specified, only upload all config files to the VMs, do not run the tests
      --log                         Specify logging level for log file output, default is DEBUG
      --screenlog                   Specify logging level for screen output, default is INFO
      -h, --help                    Show help message and exit.

A typical `runrapid.py` script execution looks like this:

You can see that some preparation work were done before the actual test are started:
. First, the script read 3 files, `rapid.env`, `basicrapid.test` and
  `machine.map`. The `env` file provides IP/MAC information of the gen and swap
  VM, and the `.test` file defines all detail behavior of the test.

. Then, the script connects to both gen and swap VM.
. The script start some small amount of traffic as "warmup". This is to test
  The reachability between the source and destination, and also populate MAC
  table or ARP table in devices along the path.
. When everything is ready, the script starts the traffic in certain speed and
  at the same time monitor the traffic receiving rate in real time. Any packet
  drop rate higher than the defined threshold indicates the current traffic
  rate is too high to the DUT, so it will drop the rate in the next iteration.
  By binary search,  eventually, it finds the maximum throughput between 2
  systems within a given allowed packet loss and accuracy which are defined in
  the `*.test` files (e.g. the `basicrapid.test` file for a simple test)

The script is highly configurable. In appendix We provide a sample
"basicrapid.test" that we use in our lab. You can start with it and fine tune
based on your need.  For example, in section `[test2]` of the file you can
change number of flow and packet size to define different test scenarios.

    [test2]
    test=flowsizetest
    packetsizes=[64,256,512,1024,1500]
    # the number of flows in the list need to be powers of 2, max 2^20

=== run PROX manually

OK. We just introduced rapid. The script support very extensive options in the
configuration files which beyond the scope of this book, but we've got the idea
how it works basically. Please remember that Rapid and PROX and two different
applications. Rapid script does all the magics and make your life easier
through automation of PROX, and PROX is the foundation application that does
the "real" works. In fact, PROX can run tests just fine without Rapid. To
launch PROX and start traffic, in the "gen" VM's home folder (`root` in our
case) start this command:

    [root@stack2-gen ~]# /root/prox/build/prox -f /root/gen.cfg

////
    Usage: /root/prox/build/prox [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-a|-e] [-m|-s|-i] [-w DEF] [-u] [-t]
            -f CONFIG_FILE : configuration file to load, ./prox.cfg by default
            -l LOG_FILE : log file name, ./prox.log by default
            -p : include PID in log file name if default log file is used
            -o DISPLAY: Set display to use, can be 'curses' (default), 'cli' or 'none'
            -v verbosity : initial logging verbosity
            -a : autostart all cores (by default)
            -e : don't autostart
            -n : Create NULL devices instead of using PCI devices, useful together with -i
            -m : list supported task modes and exit
            -s : check configuration file syntax and exit
            -i : check initialization sequence and exit
            -u : Listen on UDS /tmp/prox.sock
            -t : Listen on TCP port 8474
            -q : Pass argument to Lua interpreter, useful to define variables
            -w : define variable using syntax varname=value
                 takes precedence over variables defined in CONFIG_FILE
            -k : Log statistics to file "stats_dump" in current directory
            -d : Run as daemon, the parent process will block until PROX is not initialized
            -z : Ignore CPU topology, implies -i
            -r : Change initial screen refresh rate. If set to a lower than 0.001 seconds,
                      screen refreshing will be disabled
////

PROX will parse its configuration file `/root/gen.cfg` and start to boot.
from the booting messages in the screen we can learn its booting sequences:

* setuping the DPDK environment (RTE EAL)
* initializing (rte) devices,
* initializing mempools, port addresses, queue numbers and rings on cores
* initializing DPDK ports
* initializing tasks
* start the test and display a `ncurse` based text UI

You will end up with a `ncurse` based UI like below:

The display shows per task statistics which include: estimated idleness, per
second statistics for packets received, transmitted or dropped; per core cache
occupancy, cycles per packet, etc. These statistics can help pinpoint
bottlenecks in the system. This information can then be used to optimize the
configuration. There are quite a few other features include debugging support,
scripting, Open vSwitch support, etc. Refer to PROX website for more details.
For now, let's look at how the traffic flows. Right now from the screenshot
above we only see traffic being sent, but nothing gets received yet. Reason is
we are now running PROX manually and we only starting the "gen" side, which is
the traffic "sender" only. We need to start the "swap" VM as well as a
"receiver", who will also "loop" the traffic back to the sender, so our first
PROX application will see some "RX" statistics. Let's do that. On the compute
where "swap" VM is installed, execute the same `prox` command line, except this
time we pass a different configuration file named `swap.cfg`:

Here you will end up with a similiar ncurse based text UI, after similiar booting
process as of the sender. Once our "swap" end of PROX is up and running,
immediately you will see both "RX" and "TX" counters keep updating on both side
of the traffic:

That concludes our discussion of PROX and rapid as our testing tools. We'll use
this tools intensively in the rest of this chapter to generate different kinds
of traffic in each tests. With the traffic running, we can dig deeper to
understand the rules we've introduced about how vRouter works. Next we'll
introduce some of the commonly used tools that are designed for, or especially
useful for verfications in DPDK vRouter environment.

== dpdk vRouter tool box

In this book you've read a lot of details about DPDK and contrail DPDK vRouter
implementations. You should understand that performance boost is the main
benefit it brings. As with almost everything, it has both pros and cons. One
problem is that is commonly raised is the lack of tools during troubleshooting
process, especially in the case of a traffic loss problems. Within traditional
linux world, there are tons of well-known tools to trace the packet, from
displaying packet statistics in and out of NIC, showing drop counters, to
performing packet capture for deeper level packet decoding. Examples of these
tools are like ifconfig, ip, bmon, tcpdump, tshark, etc. With DPDK, however,
none of the traditional tools can be used directly, and the reason is obvious:
whichever interface bound to DPDK becomes invisible to the linux stack, hence
are also hidden from the perspective of these tools relying on it. In
production, we need some new tools developed to fill this gap, so that we can
narrow the packet loss related issues when the outage is ongoing. Fortunately,
today contrail dpdk vRouter are equiped with quite a few such tools. In this
section we'll look at some of them.

=== "contrail-tools" docker: vRouter tools box

"contrail-tools" is a docker container located in the compute node, where all
of the vRouter tools and utilities are available. Apparently, from the user
perspective, this is more convenient than distributing tools into multiple
containers. This design was introduced a few releases before contrail
networking R2008. As more and more existing tools migrated into it and new
tools added in, this container now really becomes a centralized "tool box",
which you'd like to open whenever you want to check any running states of the
vRouter dataplane. Let's first take a look at how to "open" this "box".

To enter the container, just run `contrail-tools` script (same name as of the
docker) in a compute node.

For the first time this was executed, the image does not exist locally so
docker will try to download from repository.

Now you are inside of the container. From here you can test all of the old
vRouter tools you may have been familiar with, for example, to print the packet
dropping statistics:

you can also pass the tool command as parameters to the script, execute the

As the time of the writing of this book, there are nearly 20 tools available in
this container. Let's take a look at what's in the package.

First, in the container we'll locate the package name:

    [root@a7s3 ~]# contrail-tools
    lcontrail-tools)[root@a7s3 /]$ rpm -qa | grep contrail-tool
    contrail-tools-2008-108.el7.x86_64

Then, based on the package name, we can list all available tools in it:

    (contrail-tools)[root@a7s3 /]$ repoquery -l contrail-tools-2008-108.el7.x86_64 | grep bin
    /usr/bin/dpdkinfo
    /usr/bin/dpdkvifstats.py

    /usr/bin/vrmemstats
    /usr/bin/vrouter
    /usr/bin/vxlan

In previous chapters you've read about `dpdk_nic_bind.py` script, which is a
tool to tell bind a specific driver for a NIC. In the rest of this section,
we'll introduce some more tools that is especially useful in DPDK environment.

=== vif command and scripts

The first one from our contrail DPDK "tool box" is `vif` command. Before
talking about it, let's see how do we list all interfaces in the compute
running DPDK vRouter. Let's first try the linux `ip` or `ifconfig` command in
our DPDK compute running PROX gen VM:

Well, we do see some interfaces got printed:

* the loop interface (lo)
* managment interface (eno1)
* vhost0 interface
* docker interface (docker0)
* physical NIC which is not in use (eno2)

However, some most important interfaces are not shown at all:

* The physical fabric interface: the "bond" interface in our setup
* The VM virtual interfaces: the "tapxxx" interfaces

If we compare with what we would see with the same ip command in a kernel mode
vRouter compute without DPDK, we will see the big differences:

Here except lo, management interface and whatever we saw from the DPDK compute,
we also see these all other important interfaces:

* bond interface and it's subinterface: `bond0`, `bond0.101`
* bond interface's member interfaces: `enp2s0f0`, `enp2s0f1`
* VM tap interface: `tap0160123b-14`
* `pkt0` interface

TIP: pkt1, pkt2, pkt3 interfaces are created by vRouter but not used in dpdk setup

////
TODO: to confirm this.
pkt1/3 GRO
pkt2 RPS:       load balancing + hashing
////

The reason we see these differences, as we've mentioned many times throughout
this book, is that when DPDK is in charge of the NIC card, linux kernel is
mostly "bypassed". The NIC card's feature and functions are exposed by another
special driver directly to the user space PMD driver running in DPDK layer, so
the traditional applications, whichever relies on the interfaces sitting in
linux kernel to do its job, are no more useful.

We'll talk more about this later. for now, let's look at the `vif` command with
`-l|--list` and `--get` option. `vif --list` lists all interfaces located in
the vRouter and `--get` just retrieves one of them.  Here is the capture from
the same DPDK compute:

TIP: Technically speaking, the `vif` interfaces are more like "ports" in
vRouter connecting to its various surrounding peers. We won't go into its
detail implementations, and will continue to call them "interfaces" to be
consistent with existing documentation.
////

Here the vRouter interfaces are:

* vif0/0: this connects to the `bond` interface
* vif0/1: this connects to `vhost0`, the interface in linux kernel
* vif0/2: this connects to the `pkt0` interface toward vrouter agent
* vif0/3: this is the vRouter interface connecting the data interface of
  our PROX VM: `tap41a9ab05-64`
* vif0/4: this is the vRouter interface connecting the control and management
  interface of our PROX VM: `tapd2d7bb67-c1`

Now you should understand the importance of `vif` command, especially in DPDK
vRouter. It shows interfaces from vRouter's perspective, and reveals the one
to one connection mapping between vRouter and fabric or VM tap interface. The
latter would be "invisible" otherwise.

Besides that, it also prints other important information. The `Vrf` numbers and
packet counters are the most commonly used data points.  Among various
counters, usually we focus on the `RX/TX` `packets/bytes` counters which
displays data received or sent in packets or bytes.  Depending on your
environment, sometime you may also see non-zero numbers in `RX/TX queue
packets/errors` counter that gives inter lcore packet statistics. It is usually
happens when two lcores are involved in the packet forwarding path.  We'll use
this command intensively in the rest of this chapter, and we'll analyze these
counters and use them to understand some of the important vRouter working
mechanisms.

`vif` tool also support some other options, use `--help` to print a brief list
of all currently supported options.

           [--clear][--id <intf_id>][--core <core_number>]
           [--help]
----

We won't talk about each every options and their usage and usually you don't
need to know anything except `--get` and `-l|--list`. There is one more
(`--add`) which we'll talk about shortly. The `--clear` option will reset all
counters, this is handy to set a quick clean baseline for later observations,
which we'll give an example later.  For others you can refer to
https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/contrail20/topics/task/configuration/vrouter-cli-utilities-vnc.html
for more details.

Next, let's look at two useful scripts that are developed based on `vif`
command: `dpdkvifstats.py` and `vifdump`.

==== dpdkvifstats.py script

We've seen `vif` command prints all interfaces and its traffic statistics
(RX/TX packets/bytes/errors, RX queue packets/errors, etc) in the form of a
"list". During testing or troubleshooting, we can collect these data to
evaluate the vRouter forwarding performance, its running status, is it losing
packets or not, etc.  In production, we always need to examine the traffic
passing through a compute.  Same thing in lab, once you start traffic from PROX
or any other traffic generators, the first thing you want to check is the
traffic rate on interfaces.  In fact there are at least two common tasks in
practice:

* monitor the traffic forwarding "rate" (instead of only number of packets)
* compare statistics between different vif interfaces

Starting from R2008 a python script named `dpdkvifstat.py` is provided, which
collects the statistics from `vif` output, calcuates the changing rate of all
counters in `pps` (packet per second) and `bps` (bit per second), based on both
per-lcore and total statistics. It then prints the result in a table format.
This makes the output looks much "prettier", and also makes comparison accross
vif interfaces much easier.

TIP: In fact `vif` command also provides `--list --rate` options to print
traffic rate. However, it is lacking of itemlized per-lcore statistics and the
display is not easy to be collected in a file.

To demonstrate how the script works, in our testbed we have configured PROX to
send traffic at a constant speed of 125000 Bytes per second (Bps) with minimum
packet size of 60 bytes. That calculates to about 1.48K packet per second (PPS).

|125000 Bps * 8 = 1000000 bps = 1M bps  | 125000 Bps / (64+20) = 1488 PPS | 1488 PPS * 60 Bytes = 89280 Bps * 8 = 714240 bps

We run the script two times. First, we run the script to show traffic rate
for vif0/3 (`-v`), then we execute it again to show traffic rate for all (`-a`)
vif interfaces for comparison purpose. In both execution, per-lcore statistics
of a specific interface are given seperately. With `-v` option, the "total"
value of the interface is also given, which is the addition of counters from
all cores. This gives a per-interface statistics. With `-a`, the script also
calculates RX/TX/RX+TX traffic rate for each lcore across all interfaces in the
end. This give the overall lcore forwarding load in the DPDK vRouter.

To understand the output, first let's review the DPDK vRouter cpu cores allocation.

In chapter 3, you've learned about DPDK vRouter architectures and you know how
the packet processing works. Basically, *vRouter creates same number of lcores
and DPDK queues as the number of CPUs allocated to it*. In this compute, for
testing purpose, we've allocated 2 CPU cores to vRouter dpdk forwarding lcores.
CPU allocatioin to DPDK vRouter forwarding lcores is configurable via vRouter
configuration files. Refer to chapter 4 for CPU allocation details. For each
vRouter interface, 2 DPDK queues are created, each served by a forwarding lcore
in DPDK process. That is why that in the output for each vif interface there
are 2 lines statistics, for "Core 1" and "Core 2" respectively.

This capture shows vRouter interface `vif 0/3` processed `1501` pps traffic in
the first forwarding lcore, that is `720640` bit per second for 60 Bytes packet
size. These are the majority of the traffic forwarded out of fabric inerface
`vif 0/0`, with a similiar rate of `1512` pps. These overlay packets received
from the VM will be tunneled in extra underlay encapsulations, MPLSoUDP in this
case, so `vif 0/0` the `bps` number (`1282176`) will be a little bit bigger
comparing with the number on the VM interface.

This script is convenient in that, it gives a straightforward overview about
the current traffic profile from vRouter's perspective. To comparing with the
original `vif` output which the script is based on, let's check what the "raw"
data looks like if without `dpdkvifstats.py` script:

We capture the interface data, wait for 1 second, and capture it again. After
that we can calculate the differences of all counters between the two captures.
We then divide each difference by 10 to get the increasing "rate" of each
counter.

* pps - packets per second: 1488 pps
* Bps - bytes per second: 1488 * 60 = 89280 Bps
* bps - bit per second: 89280 * 8 = 714240 bps

These numbers is consistent with what is seen in `dpdkvifstats.py` script.  But
to monitor multiple vif interfaces we have to repeat these steps multiple
times. Compare these manual works with having a handy script doing everything
for you!

As mentioned, `dpdkvifstats.py` script is useful to quickly retrieve a snapshot
of current traffic profile at the moment, and basically that's it. When
everything goes well that is fine. In the case of traffic loss, we often need
to first "capture" the packets themselves, then from on the packet capture we
can decode the payload and take a deeper look to analyze the issue. Now you may
say: oh you mean the `tcpdump`! Well, Yes and no. Please remember the fact that
we are in a setup where NIC card is invisible to most of the linux applications
- including `tcpdump`! Next let's briefly go over another DPDK vRouter packet
capture script: `vifdump`.

===== vifdump script

In many linux machine, `tcpdump` comes with the OS as part of a standard
packets. With that you can capture whatever packets `sensed` by a NIC, which
can be either physical NIC or virtual NIC like a `tuntap` interface, both NIC
are visible to the kernel. In DPDK environment, the difficulty of an interface
not being visible to the kernel makes `tcpdump` not able to work, unless you
just want it to read packets from a file. Fortunately, we now know that each
interface related to vRouter dataplane connects to a unique vRouter interface
(`vif`). We can make use of this fact and create something alternative.
`vifdump` is a shell script, when invoked, it use `--add` option of `vif`
command to creates a "monitoring" tun interface in linux kernel, and internally
vRouter will clones all data to be passing through the "monitored" vif
interface to this kernel interface.  `vifdump` will then start up the `tcpdump`
program to capture the packets from the "monitoring" tun interface. From a
user's perspective, the script works the same way as with `tcpdump`. Here are 2
captures on `vif0/3` toward VM, that is our PROX gen, and on `vif0/0` toward
fabric interface:

The shell script also use unix `trap` to monitor signals, and delete the monitoring
interface when the signals appear. The mostly used signal is `SIGINT` triggered
by `ctrl-c` keystroke pressed by user from keyboard to stop the capture. That
is why we see `vifdump: deleting vif 4351...` message in the end of each capture.

`dpdkvifstats.py` and `vifdump` are two scripts developed based on `vif`
command. With these tools we can collect general packet RX/TX counters and
packets contents.

In next section, we'll take a look another powerful debug tool that is
useful in DPDK environment: `dpdkinfo`.

==== dpdkinfo command

////
As you have learned so far, in a compute where DPDK is "in charge", basically
the kernel is "bypassed" and whatever is happening in DPDK's teritory is
invisble to the kernel. That means most (if not all) tools built from linux
kernel won't be able to help much. In fact you can't even list any DPDK
interfaces with linux tool, not to mention checking into the low level details
of an interface. The purpose of `dpdkinfo` tool is reads the internal data structure
from vRouter and DPDK library and print them.

We've talked about `vif` and `dpdkvifstats.py` tools. Now let's introduce a
relatively new tool that can be used to investigate lower level details of DPDK
interfaces. `dpdkinfo` is introduced since Contrail 20.08. Using this tool
Contrail operators can collect more information about DPDK vRouter fabric
interface internal status, connectivity (physical NIC bond), DPDK library
information, and some other statistics.

Let's first run the tool with `-h` to get a brief menu of it:

[source, sh, linenums]
----
(contrail-tools)[root@a7s3 /]$ dpdkinfo -h
Usage: dpdkinfo
       --help
       --version|-v                  Show DPDK Version
       --bond|-b                     Show Master/Slave bond information
       --lacp|-l     <all/conf>      Show LACP information from DPDK
       --mempool|-m  <all/<mempool-name>>  Show Mempool information
       --stats|-n    <eth>           Show Stats information
       --xstats|-x   <=all/=0(Master)/=1(Slave(0))/=2(Slave(1))>
                                     Show Extended Stats information
       --lcore|-c                    Show Lcore information
       --app|-a                      Show App information
    Optional: --buffsz      <value>  Send output buffer size (less than 1000Mb)
----

From this help information we can see it provides information about DPDK
interface in multiple areas. In this rest of this section, let's take a look at
some of the most useful options, they are:

* `--version|-v`
* `--bond|-b`
* `--lacp|-l`
* `--stats|-n`
* `--xstats|-x`
* `--lcore|-c`

There are some other options like `--app|-a`, `--mempool|-m` we won't
introduced in this book, and the list of supported functions may grow in each
future releases. But you will get the basic idea of its usage and you can refer
the official documents for other usage informations.

===== version

The `-v` or `--version` option reports the basic version information of dpdk release in use.

[source, sh, linenums]
----
(contrail-tools)[root@a7s3 /]$ dpdkinfo -v
DPDK Version: DPDK 19.11.0
vRouter version: {"build-info": [{"build-time": "2020-09-04 10:38:22.330666", "build-hostname": "6fb64a1f86b9", "build-user": "root", "build-version": "2004"}]}
----

===== bond and LACP status

`-b` or `--bond` option print detail information about the bond interface
managed by DPDK. The output is organized in a similiar form as what you would
see for the bond status managed by linux kernel. Compare this output below with
`cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0` output from a compute running kernel mode vRouter:

.`dpdkinfo -b` vs. `cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0`
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/95601792-faa13700-0a21-11eb-8cd9-4767277f9f25.png[image]

//.`dpdkinfo -b`
//image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/95599375-fcb5c680-0a1e-11eb-834d-ddf3359f817c.png[image]
//
//.`cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0`
//image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/95599828-98dfcd80-0a1f-11eb-86d3-7330f1154c45.png[image]

Basically now you can have same information as of linux kernel bond0, such as
bonding mode, transmit hash policy, system MAC and aggregator information, etc.
In this example the current bonding mode is `802.3AD dynamic link aggregation`,
indicating LACP protocol is configured between compute and peer device (in our
environment it's a TOR switch). The `Transmit Hash Policy` shows `Layer 3+4 (IP
Addresses + UDP Ports) transmit load balancing`, which the bond allows for
traffic to a particular network peer to span multiple slaves for load balancing
purpose. This is achieved by calculating a hash value for each packet from
the IP addresses and UDP ports in the outer header of the packet, and then
distributing the packet based on the hash value.

The commmand outupt also displays each member(slave) link's information, its
current driver, MAC address, up/down status, etc. 

////
You may notice that the
slave interface is identified using PCI bus number (0000:02:00.0 and
0000:02:00.1) instead of interface name as comparing with linux bond. Again the
reason is that the interface name is created by linux kernel, which is
"bypassed" in dpdk.

Here, you can get more insight of LACP running status, including all LACP
timers and PDU statistics about number of packet exchanged with the peer
device. Of course, here the counters are LACP PDU only. If we need all packets
received and sent through the bond interface, we can use `-n|--stats` option.

===== bond packet counters

`-n|--stats` option is useful to look into packet statistics of bond interface.
So far we've seen at least 2 ways of retreiving packet counters from a vif
interface:

* `vif --get X`
* `dpdkvifstats.py -v X`

DPDK bond interface is represented by vRouter interface `vif0/0`, so you may
think setting X to 0 in the above commands achieves the same effect. The
problem is none of these tools print packet statistics for each member link of
the bond.  Let's take a look at an example here:

With the `--stats eth` option, `dpdkinfo` prints traffic distribution among all
member links of a DPDK bond interfaces. For example, in this example, we are
seeing the first member link(PCI bus 0000:02:00.0) received 1421 packets, while
the second member link (PCI bus 0000:02:00.1) received 28359275 packets. It is
obvious that the second member link carries most part of the traffic. Maybe you
are wondering why we end up with imbalanced traffic distributions, because
previously we've mentioned earlier that `Transmit Hash Policy` is set to load
balancing across member links. The reason is in this test environment we are
sending just one UDP flow!


//RX: 28359275 + 1421 = 28360696 - 28360664 = 32
//TX: 28358167 + 3039 = 28361206 - 28361174 = 32

With more flows we'll see the balance happens. let's send 10 flows, but before
that let's clear the current counters to make our second camparison easier:

[source, sh, linenums]
----
[root@a7s3 ~]# contrail-tools vif --clear

Vif stats cleared successfully on all cores for all interfaces
----

Now we start rapid script to send 64 flows, and check same `dpdkinfo` command
output again:

[source, sh, linenums]
----
 [root@a7s3 ~]# contrail-tools dpdkinfo -n eth

From the member link packet statistics, we are sure the traffic get
balanced on both links.
//228370 + 242872 = 471242 - 471211 = 31

Now you understand the `-stats|-n` option provides the insight of member link
usage reflected by a few RX/TX counters. Base on these information we can
determine the load balance status of a DPDK bond interface. So far all of the
packet counters we've seen, no matter under master or members, are almost the
same ones as what are provided by `vif` command. In practice, if you need to
get more extensive statistics, there is another option `xstats|-x`. Let's go
check it out:

As you can see, the output is *very* extensive - perhaps ten times more than
what `vif`, `dpdkvifstats.py` and `dpdkinfo -n eth` give. In fact to shorten
the output, we've removed all counters with a zero value in it, and also edited
the output format to compact all texts in two columns. if you go through it
quickly, you will be able to tell the fact that the majority part of the
traffic is composed of packets with size between 65 to 127 bytes, and that is
what we are sending from rapid script. Increasing traffic packet size from
rapid will end up with a different result:

We won't discuss all counters listed in this output, for now just add
`dpdkinfo` with these two options `-n|stats` and `-x|xstats` in your DPDK
vRouter troubleshooting toolkits. Consider to use them to collect information
whenever you run into traffic loss issues during your lab test or production
deployment.

//TODO: add vifdump here is also good

Next we'll explore another interesting option `-c|--lcore`.

===== lcore

There are several key concepts we've been trying to illustrate in this book.
Among others, at least four of them are often mentioned together: `lcore`,
`interface` and `queue`. Before we start introducing `-c|--lcore` option, let's
briefly review these concepts.

`lcore` :: lcore is a thread in vRouter DPDK process running in user space
`interface`:: is the endpoints of connections between vRouter and other VM, or
between vRouter and the outside of the compute. At the vRouter and VM end, the
interfaces are called `vif` and `tap` interfaces respectively. There are also
bond0 physical interface in DPDK user space and `vhost0` interface in linux
kernel. The former is the physically NIC bundle connecting to the peer device,
and the latter give the host an IP address and through with the vRouter agent
can exchange control plane messages with the controller.
`queue`:: for each interface there are some queues created. They are
essentially some memories allocated to hold the packets.

The CPU cores connect all these objects together. As of the writing of this
book, the implemention is to have one to one mapping between the number of CPU
cores allocated to vRouter and the number of interface queues. For example, if
4 CPUs are allocated to DPDK vRouter forwarding threads (the `lcores`), then 4
lcores will be created, and 4 DPDK interface queues will be created for each
vif interface. Same rule applies to the VM - You assign 4 CPU cores to a VM,
then by default, Nova will create 4 (virtio??) queues for a tap interface in the
VM. That said, of course, `multiple queue` as a feature needs to be turned on
in Nova at the first place. We can illustrate this with a table below:

[options="header", width="50%",cols="5*^.^"]
|====
    | vif   | queue | lcore      | queue | tap(vNIC)
 .4+| 0/3   | 0     | 0          |  0 .4+| tap003
            | 1     | 1          |  1
            | 2     | 2          |  2
            | 3     | 3          |  3
 .4+| 0/4   | 0     | 0          |  0 .4+| tap004
            | 1     | 1          |  1
            | 2     | 2          |  2
            | 3     | 3          |  3
|====


This is just a simple example. In production deployment there are a lot more
conditions to consider, and a lot of of confusions rise. Common questions are:

* What if the tap interface queue number is different than the vif queue
  number? What will happen when we have 8 lcores, but one of our VM are running
  4 queues in its tap interface?
* will vif0/3 queue0 always be served by lcore0, instead of other lcores?
  if not, how to determine which vif queue goes to which lcore? Is there a
  chance that imbalanced lcores to queue mapping happens, so that some lcores
  are overloaded and some lcores are relatively idle?

To answer these questions, we need a tool to reveal the "secret" of actual
mapping between lcores and queues from different vif interfaces. This is the
moment for `-c|--lcore` option of `dpdkinfo` to show its power. Again, let's
start with an example:

////
more granular info about each fwding core
assign each fwding core to pull another particular interface queue
interface can be pnic, vertio or tap
there is  no easy way to tell which fwding core is pulling which interface and which queue.

Let's start from the first line. In this example, we have allocated two
CPU cores to DPDK vRouter forwarding lcores, so we have 2 forwarding lcores
running in total.

Then, the second line give number of vRouter interfaces in the compute. We have
4 of them in total. One vif0/4 connecting to VM tap interface `tap41a9ab05-64`,
three mandatory vif0/0, vif0/1, vif0/2, connecting to bond, vhost0 and pkt0
respectively.  Here, we have created just one VM (actually this is nothing but
the PROX gen VM we've created earlier) with only one tap interface.

Starting from the third line onward are what we'll focus now. The output is
listing all forwarding lcores that are currently configured in vRouter, and for
each lcore it list interfaces that this lcore is associcated with - in another
word, interfaces this core is "serving".

Please note that there are some inconsistencies in term of the lcore numbering
in different tools.
* In `dpdkvifstats.py` script, forwarding lcore number starts from "1", so
  "Core 1" refers to the first forwarding lcore.
* In `dpdkinnfo -c` output, forwarding lcore number starts from "0", so "Lcore
  0" refers to the first forwarding lcore.
* In `vif` output, forwarding lcore number starts from "10", so "--core 10"
  refers to the first forwarding lcore.

This may cause some confusions in our discussions. To make it consistent, in
the rest of this chapter we'll use "the first forwarding lcore", `fwd lcore#10`,
or simply `lcore#10`; "the second forwarding lcore", `fwd lcore#11`, or simply
`lcore#11`, and so on, to indicate "Lcore 0", "Lcore 1" in `dpdkinfo
-c` output, "Core 1", "Core 2" in `dpdkvifstats.py` script output, and "Core
10", "Core 11" in `vif` output, respectively.

[options="header", width="50%",cols="4*^.^"]
|====
| vif       | `dpdkinfo -c` | dpdkvifstats.py | meaning
| `Core 10` | Lcore 0       | Core 1          | 1st forwarding lcore: lcore#10
| `Core 11` | Lcore 1       | Core 2          | 2nd forwarding lcore: lcore#11
|====


OK. As you may have realized, in the VM interface we use just one queue, which
means the "multiple queue" feature on the VM interface is *not* enabled.
Therefore the VM tap interface has only one queue connecting to its peering
vRouter interface. Correspondingly, only one queue in vRouter interface is
needed and only one lcore is required to serve the packet forwarding in the vif
interface.

First, Let's look at the `bond0` and `vhost0` interfaces. `bond0` are the
physical interfaces, and it will always has `multiple queues` enabled, that is
why it has two queues, and both lcores serve it. The `vhost0` interface is a
control plane linux interface. As the time of writing of this book, the
implementation is to hard-code vhost0 with one queue only. The first forwarding
thread `lcore#10` got it. This is not the focus in this section but worth to
know to understand the whole output.

Finally, Let's look at the last line - the VM tap interface. From the output,
we see it is the second forwarding lcore (`lcore#11`) being assigned to this VM
interface. You probably wonder is it just randomly chosen out of the 2 lcores
or some algorithms are used? It is not like that. Currently the allocation
basically follows a simple method. *The least used lcore, in term of number of
interface queues it is serving, will be assigned to serve the next interface
queue.* Based on what we just explained, `lcore#10` took two interfaces
(`bond0.101` and `vhost0`) while `lcore#11` took just one (`bond0.101`), so it
is `lcore#11`'s turn to take the next interface and queue.

IMPORTANT: vNIC queues are assigned to logical cores in the following
algorithm: The forwarding core that is currently polling the least number of
queues is selected, with a tie won by the core with the lowest number (the
first forwarding core lcore#10).

We'll see more examples in later sections, in there we'll test out the "tie
breaker" and other things. We can convert the above mapping into a table
like this:

[options="header", width="50%",cols="5*^.^"]
|====
    | vif   | queue | lcore      | queue | tap(vNIC)
 .2+| 0/0   | 0     | 0          |  0 .2+| bond0
            | 1     | 1          |  1
    | 0/1   | 0     | 0          |  0    | vhost0
    | 0/3   | 0     | 1          |  0    | tap41a9ab05-64
|====

Now we've went through `dpdkinfo` command and demonstrated some most commonly
used options. With this command you can quickly print out a lot of useful
information about DPDK and DPDK vRouter running status. We'll review this again
later in our test case studies. These information is important to know before
we work on any deployment or troubleshooting task in the setup. However, when
things go wrong, instead of just relying on the dpdk commands output, you may
also want to check into the log messages to verify the current running status
is as what you've expected it to be. Next we'll take a look at DPDK vRouter log
messages.

==== dpdk vRouter log files

////
TODO: this is copied and rewritten based on Laurent's chapter 5.
will need to capture in same environment and rewrite again.
////

Contrails DPDK vrouter dataplane log file is named `contrail-vrouter-dpdk.log`.
Depending on the version or installation methods, it can be located in
different folders or even with a totally different name. For example:

* in latest TripleO deployment: `/var/log/containers/contrail/dpdk/contrail-vrouter-dpdk.log`
* in latest ansible deployment: `/var/log/contrail/contrail-vrouter-dpdk.log`
* in older 3.x ubuntu deployemnt: `/var/log/contrail.log`

This log file contains lots of good information that is helpful to understand
the current running status. Understanding the log messages are important during
troubleshooting process.

===== DPDK vrouter parameters

Each time the vrouter is started, the main configuration parameters are listed
in the log file during the vrouter initialization stage. We can see the DPDK
library version that has be use to build the DPDK vrouter binary program.

//but also the different values that are used for the different setup parameters.

Here is an example:

----

Here we see a complete list of vRouter start up parameters of
this Contrail vRouter, for example:

* `build-version` "2008"
* is running DPDK Version `19.11.0`.
* `Nexthops limit` parameter is configured as 32768 - decreased from the
  default value (65536).
* CPU core #4 is pinned to be used by control and service thread
  (`VR_SERVICE_CORE_MASK: 0x10`)

We can compare these information with what we can print with these command line
tools and see if they are consistent:

* `contrail-version`
* `dpdkinfo -v`
* `vrouter --info`
* `taskset`

Any inconsistency will provide a clue to proceed in that area.

===== Polling core allocation

In chapter 3 we've introduced that DPDK vRouter process is a multiple threads
application and the threads falls into different categories based on their
roles. This is also reflected by some log entries. Before we dive into the
logs, Let's do a quick review of the three thread categories:

Control threads:: They are generated by DPDK libraries and are used during
Contrail vRouter startup for DPDK initialization. control threads are not our
focus in this book.
Service threads:: There are totally hard-coded two service threads
named `lcore0` through `lcore9`. Each lcore has its own role. For example
`lcore9` serves `netlink` connection between agent and vRouter data plane.
Details of each lcore's rule is out of this book's scope. We just need to know
they are used to serve communication between vrouter agent and vrouter
forwarding plane.
Forwarding threads:: After service threads, from `lcore10` and onward, the
forwarding threads are the main horse power that performs the packet forwarding
tasks and determines the performance of DPDK vRouter. This is the main focus of
our book.

NOTE: In service threads, `lcore3` to `lcore7` are never used in contrail DPDK
vRouter.

OK. Now let's take a look at a interesting log entry:

    2020-09-16 09:06:50,886 VROUTER: --lcores  "(0-2)@(10,34),(8-9)@(10,34),*10@2,11@4,12@6,13@8*

Here, we understand the string `--lcores` means a service thread, or a
forwarding thread. Following this string is a few coupled numbers connected by
`@` - "NUMBER@NUMBER" - which are seperated by commas. How to decode these?
Well, to understand this we need to understand CPU pinning. To achieve maximum
performance we're pinning the service and forwarding threads(or `lcores`) each
with a few specific CPU cores, so each thread will be served by dedicated CPUs
that are isolated from any other system tasks. So this log reads:

* Service threads, that is lcore0 to lcore2 and lcore8-lcore9 in the message, are all
  pinned to two CPU cores: core#10 and CPU core#34.
  The pinning is configured by the `SERVICE_CORE_MASK` parameter.
* Forwarding threads, lcore10 to lcore13, are allocated are pinned to CPU
  core#2, core#4, core#6 and core#8, respectively.
  This is configured from the `CPU_LIST` parameter.

////
* lcore 0 to 2 and above are defined with *_CPU_LIST_*
* lcore 8 to 9 and above are defined with *_SERVICE_CORE_MASK_*
* lcore numbers 10 and above are defined with *_DPDK_CTRL_THREAD_MASK_*
////

===== Internal Load Balancing

In some situation the polling core performs a new hash calculation to
distribute the polled packets to another processing core. This is a DPDK
"pipeline model" implemented in the vrouter.

//In this situation, the polling core will never select itself to process a polled packet.

This distribution behavior can be observed in the following messages in DPDK
log file:

    2020-01-07 13:08:01,403 VROUTER: Lcore 10: distributing MPLSoGRE packets to [11,12,13]
    2020-01-07 13:08:01,403 VROUTER: Lcore 11: distributing MPLSoGRE packets to [10,12,13]
    2020-01-07 13:08:01,403 VROUTER: Lcore 12: distributing MPLSoGRE packets to [10,11,13]
    2020-01-07 13:08:01,404 VROUTER: Lcore 13: distributing MPLSoGRE packets to [10,11,12]

Here the logs show `MPLSoGRE`, but it actually applies to both MPLSoGRE or
`VxLAN` packets.  this is due to historically only MPLS GRE was supported. So,
it remains like that in the software code.  Here is means both MPLSoGRE and
VxLAN packet will be distributed via hashing by the polling core.

//TODO: why always "MPLSoGRE" is used?

ifndef::word[image::../diagrams/extracted-media-chapter5.docx/media/image1.png[image]]

===== Virtual Interface queues

Each time a new virtual interface is connected to the vrouter, a vif port is
created on the vrouter with the same number of queues as the number of polling
CPU (specified in `CPU_LIST` parameter). Each queue created is handled by only
one of the vrouter polling core. So, for each vif, we have a one to one mapping
between vrouter polling cores and RX queues. This mapping can be seen from
`dpdkinfo -c` command output which we've introduced. The same can be observed
in DPDK vrouter logs:

    2019-09-24 16:36:50,011 VROUTER: Adding vif 8 (gen. 37) virtual device tap66e68bc1-a9
    ....
    2019-09-24 16:36:50,012 VROUTER: lcore 12 RX from HW queue 0
    2019-09-24 16:36:50,012 VROUTER: lcore 13 RX from HW queue 1
    2019-09-24 16:36:50,012 VROUTER: lcore 10 RX from HW queue 2
    2019-09-24 16:36:50,012 VROUTER: lcore 11 RX from HW queue 3

Here the vif interface 0/8 is created in order to connect the virtual NIC
tap66e68bc1-a9 to the vrouter. Because 4 forwarding lcores are configured, this
vif is created with 4 queues, namely q0 to q3, which are respectively handled
by polling cores 12,13,10 and 11.

////
The connected virtual machine interface can have a different number of queues
than the number of queues configured on the vrouter vif interface it is
connected to. Basically 3 cases have to be taken into consideration:

* The connected virtual machine network interface has less queues than the
  number of queues created on the vrouter interface. Some vrouter interface
  queues won't be enabled.
* The connected virtual machine network interface has the same number of queues
  than the number of queues created on the vrouter interface. All vrouter
  interface queues will be enabled.
* The connected virtual machine network interface has more queues than the
  number of queues created on the vrouter interface. This is an unsupported
  case. Some virtual machine interface queues won't be polled as there is no
  matching queue on the vif it is connected to. Some queues have to be disabled
  on the virtual machine NIC network interface.
////

When a polling queue is enabled on the vrouter, a ring activation message is
generated in the Contrail DPDK log file.

The vrings correspond to both transmit and receive queues:

* the transmit queues are the even numbers. Divide them by 2 to get the queue
  number. i.e. vring 0 is TX queue 0, vring 2 is TX queue 1, …
* the receive queues are the odd numbers. Divide them by 2 (discard the
  remainder) to get the queue number. i.e. vring 1 is RX queue 0, vring 3 is RX
  queue 1,
* ready state 1 = enabled. ready state 0 = disabled

ifdef::word[image::../diagrams/extracted-media-chapter5.docx/media/image2.emf[image]]
ifndef::word[image::../diagrams/extracted-media-chapter5.docx/media/image2.png[image]]

In the example below, only 1 RX (and TX) queue is enabled on the vrouter vif
interface. A single queue virtual machine interface is connected to the vrouter
port:

    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 0 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 1 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 2 ready state 0
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 3 ready state 0
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 4 ready state 0
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 5 ready state 0
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 6 ready state 0
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 7 ready state 0

In the example hereafter, 4 RX (and TX) queues are enabled on the vrouter vif
interface. But a virtual machine interface having more than 4 queues is
connected to the vrouter port:

    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 0 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 1 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 2 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 3 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 4 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 5 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 6 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: setting vring 7 ready state 1
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: vr_uvhm_set_vring_enable: Can not disable TX queue 4 (only 4 queues)
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: Client _tap66e68bc1-a9: handling message 18
    2019-09-24 16:37:46,693 UVHOST: vr_uvhm_set_vring_enable: Can not disable RX queue 4 (only 4 queues)

As there are more than 4 queues on the virtual machine interface, some queues
must not be enabled on the virtual machine NIC. Unfortunately, these queues can
’t be disabled on the virtual machine. Therefore, this setup is faulty.

=== dpdk vRouter case studies

In previous sections, we've introduced some dpdk tools and explained some
important log entries.
to help collecting DPDK vRouter running status.

==== single queue

Having understood the lcore mapping basics, let's start a test with some
traffic flowing.

===== one way single flow: VM to fabric

To make it very simple, we are sending single uni-directional UDP flow from the
PROX gen VM. We can list current flows we have in vRouter to confirm this.

Here, we see 6 vRouter flows, which are in fact 3 groups. The first 2 groups
with index pairs `40196`/`436016` and `62792`/`172020` are generated by the
control messages from rapid "jump" VM into the PROX gen VM. The last group of
flows with index pairs `38232`/`257372` is our single flow test traffic. The
`stats` `39003/48360372` shows the traffic flow is sent from gen VM
(`192.168.1.104:32770`) to swap VM (`192.168.1.105:32768`).

//TODO: why PROX needs 2 sessions? what is 8474?

NOTE: In contrail vRouter, flows are generated in pairs. For any traffic, even
if it is one direction only, vRouter will generate a "reverse flow" for it.
This is because in real world most of the traffic are bidirectional, so having
an seperate entry built for each direction is required. In our case, from PROX
we are generating uni-directional traffic, so only flow of that direction has
packet statistics. it's pairing flow entry is generated as well, but packet
statistics shows nothing.

Let's clear vif counters, and collect the statistics using `dpdkvifstats.py`
tool:

From The first capture on the vRouter interface connecting to the PROX gen VM
tap interface (`-v 3`), we are seeing "lcore#10" received the traffic - we
can tell from the RX speed `1504 pps` showing in "Core 1" only. The second
capture on the vRouter interface toward bond interface (`-v 0`) confirmed the
same - it is the same `lcore#10` ("Core 1" here) that is sending the traffic
to the bond interface, at speed of 1512 pps, almost the same as the speed it
received the traffic from VM tap interface. This flow is illustrated here:

    VM: tap41a9ab05-64 => vif0/3 => lcore#10 => vif0/0 => bond0

This seems to be "weird", does it? Remember previously based on the
core-interface mapping given by `dpdkinfo -c` We already knew it was the
`lcore#11` serving our VM interface, not the other one.
Accordingly, in `dpdkvifstats.py` output, that should be "Core 2" instead of
"Core 1". Let's revisit the mapping:

        Interface: tap41a9ab05-64      Queue ID: 0
----

So we are right. The flow that is "expected" should be something like this:

    VM: tap41a9ab05-64 => vif0/3 => lcore#11 => vif0/0 => bond0

Well, if you remember what you've read in chapter 3, you probably will know the
answer. When a packet flows from our PROX gen VM to the bond, vRouter uses a
`pipeline model` to process the packet. What that really means is, the
interface's serving lcore, that is the second forwarding lcore in our case
based on `dpdkinfo -c` output, will poll it out of the vif interface. In
chapter 3, when we introduce the vRouter packet forwarding process, we've
mentioned the when traffic flows from vif connecting VM tap interface to
vif0/0, all packets will be distributed by the "polling lcore" to other lcores
for processing. The distribution is calculated based on the hash of the packet
header.

Apparently, Here the "polling" core, based on the mapping above, is `lcore#11`,
and the only "other" lcore is the first forwarding lcore `lcore#10`.
So packets from VM got polled by the `lcore#11` and then distributed to the
`lcore#10`, which then forwarded to the fabric interface vif0/0.
Currently `dpdkvifstats.py` does not tell much about these details, but if you
collect `vif` output, you will see some more clues:

//TODO: in chapter 3, there is no mentioning about VM -> fabric flow/distribution/etc.

There is a "RX queue" counter `Core 11 RX queue  packets:35384` gives a little
bit clue about this inter-core distribution. `Core 11`, our second forwarding
lcore, polled the packet first from vif0/3 into its RX queue. Instead of
"processing" the packet, it distributed oto the first forwarding lcore, `Core
10`, which, then "processed" them. That is why same amount of packets are
counted as `RX packets` in `Core 10`. Therefore the full story is a flow like
this:

                             (polling lcore) (processing lcore)
 VM: tap41a9ab05-64 => vif0/3 => lcore#11 => lcore#10 => vif0/0 => bond0

For the sake of completeness, we also captured the vif command on fabric
interface vif0/0:

Here after the first forwarding lcore processed the packets from vif0/0, it
sent them out of vif0/0, which is reflected as `TX packets` and `TX device
packets`.

IMPORTANT: What we've tested and demonstrated is the DPDK vRouter default
behavior with the current parameters it current takes. Please keep in mind that
vRouter is configurable. There is one vRouter configuration option introduced
in release R2008 which will change this default `pipeline model` behavior. This
option is `--vr_no_load_balance`, and we can verify the vrouter-dpdk process
running command line in our setup with `ps` command. With that configured,
vRouter will change to the so-called `run to complete model`, which means same
lcore whichever polled the packet will continue to process/forward it. This
requires reboot of DPDK vRouter, and We won't test this scenarios in this book.

This concludes the analysis of traffic forwarding in the direction of VM to
fabric. Next let's take a look at the returning direction: from fabric (vif0/0)
to VM (vif0/3).

===== returning traffic: fabric to VM

Now we add returning traffic. We configure the swap VM in such a way that it
loops whatever it received back to the sender. Here is the capture:

[source, sh, linenums]

Here, we are looking at the returning traffic from fabric back to our PROX gen
VM:

                  RX                            TX
    fabric: bond0 => vif0/0 => lcore#? => vif0/3 => tap41a9ab05-64 => VM

So we focus on seeing the `RX` in vif 0/0 and `TX` in vif0/3, and the data
shows `lcore#11` received the packets from vif0/0 and forwarded out of vif0/3.
To confirm if this lcore is also the polling lcore, we'll need to look at the
`vif` capture:

We do not see any `RX queue` packets as what we've seen in the data we
collected on the VM to fabric direction. Therefore in this direction we don't
see any inter-core load balancing behavior as we've elaborated before. The
reason is in this test vRouter is using VxLAN encapsulations for the fabric
interface, which follows the "Run-to-completion model" that we've explained in
chapter 3, i.e. one forwarding lcore polls for packets, make forwarding
decision, and forward the packet out of the other interface.

This concludes our analysis to the bidirectional single flow traffic.  As you
can see, one benefit to have traffic generator/swapper built in lab environment
is, we can fine tune the generator to send traffic in a very specific pattern,
so that we can take a deep look at the counters and analyze the vRouter traffic
forwarding behavior.  This is very helpful for learning purpose. In production,
you probably never expect to has such a "luxury" since the traffic pattern in
the "field" is usually much more complex. But don't worry, we can add more and
more complexities to our traffic pattern so eventually you will see something
close to what you would see in real life.

Next, we'll add more flows in our testbed and check the result.

===== multiple flows

Here, we are sending 64 flows from PROX gen VM. To confirm the flow numbers we
use `flow -s` command in `contrail-tools`:

Still, the `lcore#10` processed the packets and forwarded to out of vif0/0.
If you compare this result with our first test, where we have just one
uni-directional flow, there is simply no difference. Shouldn't we expect to see
some load balance between lcores since we have more flows now? We should, but
that is only when the VM tap interface has "multiple queues". With just one
queue, the mapping between our tap interface and lcores never changes. In our
case it's always lcore#11 polling the traffic and distributing to
`lcore#10`, hence we'll always see packet being forwarded by `lcore#10` instead
of `lcore#11`, regardless of number of flows and traffic volumes.

On the other direction, if we enable the returning traffic, we'll see on `VIF
0` (vif0/0) the two lcores' traffic are `RX pps: 41547` and `RX pps: 44257`,
which is well balanced - because we have two queues enabled on the vif0/0.

IMPORTANT: With single queue in VM tap interface, it's hard to achieve good
load balance between lcores on the vRouter interface facing the Virtual
Machine. Sometime we need to enable "multiple queue" to make better use of all
our DPDK forwarding lcores.

This concludes our analysis on one single queue test, and we'll go ahead to
test "multiple queues".

==== multiple queues

Let's look at a multiple queue example.

Based on the previous setup, this time we added one more queue in tap interface
of VM gen and then collect the core interface mapping:

[source, sh, linenums]
----
[root@a7s3 ~]# contrail-tools dpdkinfo -c
No. of forwarding lcores: 2
No. of interfaces: 5
Lcore 0:
        Interface: bond0.101           Queue ID: 0
        Interface: vhost0              Queue ID: 0
        Interface: tap41a9ab05-64      Queue ID: 1

Lcore 1:
        Interface: bond0.101           Queue ID: 1
        Interface: tap41a9ab05-64      Queue ID: 0
----

Here is the table view of these mapping:

[options="header", width="50%",cols="5*^.^"]
|====
    | vif   | queue | lcore      | queue | tap(vNIC)
 .2+| 0/0   | 0     | 0          |  0 .2+| bond0
            | 1     | 1          |  1
    | 0/1   | 0     | 0          |  0    | vhost0
 .2+| 0/3   | 0     | 1          |  0 .2+| tap41a9ab05-64
            | 1     | 0          |  1
|====

So most items remains the same, except we have one more queque added on tap and
the vRouter interface to which it attaches, correspondingly, one core is
allocated to serve this new queue. Before this new queue was created we already
know that each of our lcores is serving same amount of queues, therefore as a
"tie breaker", which we've mentioned when we introduce `dpdkinfo -c`
previously, the first forwarding lcore, `lcore#10` with our notation, is
allocated for the new queue.

Let's check the traffic distribution between lcores with multiple queues on VM
tap interface:

[source, sh, linenums]

 [root@a7s3 ~]# contrail-tools dpdkvifstats.py -all -c 2

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 |Core 2  |TX + RX pps: 173731    | TX pps 86807     | RX pps 86924     |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |Total   |TX + RX pps: 342147    | TX pps 171065    | RX pps 171082    |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Now, since we have multiple queues on both VM tap interface and the fabric
interface. Traffic on all lcores are very well balanced. Please keep this in
mind as an "ideal" traffic profile that we are expecting the vRouter to has. In
production, we usually deal with more complicated vRouter lcore configurations
and traffic profiles, so the lcore balancing may be appear as perfect as what
we are seeing in lab environment, but at least you have a good baseline in your
mind and knows what to look when the result is far worse than expected.

//Let's move on to take a look at one of the "bad case", which we know for sure
//vRouter won't work well under that condition.

////
TODO: 
* a "bad case", tap queue num > lcore num
* make 4 lcores and redo everything, depending on time.

=== no enough fwding cores: TODO or skip

For service provider's perspective, a contrail compute node basically carries
two entities, vRouter softwares from Juniper, and VNFs from other vendors.
vRouter is the underlying platform that serves all VNFs to implement packet
forwarding role. On the other hand, the deployment and operation are conducted
by different teams working with each other. Most of the time this working model
is perfectly fine. In some cases, however, it may produce issues.

For example, The vRouter operator, based on the design, may decide to configure
8 forwarding lcores, which in most cases are good enough. The VNF operator, in
contrast, may prefer to assign 10 or 16 queues to the tap interfaces of some
their VMs carrying most service traffic for performance improvement. If the two
teams do not communicate well and collaborate tightly, things will not work
well, and usually it will be a headache to troubleshoot this type of issues -
Everything is up and running and nothing is really "down", but VNF folks just
can't reach the performance they want. they may start to scratch their heads
and go through all of the configurations just to confirm that "everything is
correct but just doesn't work well".

There are surely a lot of other "bad" examples we can talk about, in this book,
we'll analyze this one only - the problem caused by having a VNF having number
of queues exceeding number of vRouter forwarding lcores.

2 fwding cores, 4 tap queues, packet drop
